# mwnci
Monkey programming language interpreter designed in [_Writing An Interpreter In Go_](https://interpreterbook.com/).
A [_current guide_](http://mwnci.ploogie.co.uk) is available, though still work in progress. 

It's based on [Steve Kemp's monkey](https://github.com/skx/monkey) with many additions

Monkey Scripting Language (MSL) is an interpreted language (I've not read the sequel to "Writing An Interpreter In Go") for writing applications. It's also a good language for writing arbitrary commands and tasks.

A MSL script consists of a sequence of commands. It is, for the most part, a free form language. That is, lines don't have to start or end at or before a particular column; they can just continue on the next line. White space is ignored except for the separation of tokens.

Mwnci is Welsh for Monkey, and pronounced moon-key, but with a shorter "oo" (as in look/book). It's fine to say monkey
